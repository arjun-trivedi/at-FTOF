### Notes on at_contrib.tex

## [10-12-14]
* Address the matter of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2: see if they exist already, else re-draw them.
* "(...) the anode signal of the PMT was digitized and processed by a DAQ system (...)" -> May be irrelevant if the final measurements are going to be directly off the oscillosope.
* Confirm that at 10G-L and 20G-T with only Mu-metal shielding the reduction of signal amplitude is indeed 10% for this are the reduction levels at which RS found no affect on the time resolution.
* The scintillators used for the time resolution tests mentioned in RS's thesis were 6cmX6cmX120cm Bicron BC-404 and the PMTs were Hamamatsu R9779
* When quoting that at 10% reduction levels in the T and L orientations, the measured time resolution was 41 ps and 38 ps respectively, compared to 38 ps with no magnetic fields, how do we give an estimate of the errors?
* Measure thickness of mu-metal coating using a broken PMT
* Establish if we are going to use 25G or 30G as the limit for which the final shielding was designed
* Quantify "few" mms that the "two edges" of the scintillators were shaved off by
* Confirm if 4cm(1.5in) is indeed the final overhang
